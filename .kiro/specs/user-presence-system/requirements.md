# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A user presence and online status system will enhance the marketplace by allowing clients to see which providers are currently active and available. This feature will improve response times, user engagement, and help clients make better decisions when choosing providers based on their availability and recent activity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client, I want to see which providers are currently online, so that I can contact providers who are likely to respond quickly to my service requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the app or website THEN the system SHALL mark them as online
2. WHEN a user is active (clicking, typing, navigating) THEN the system SHALL update their last activity timestamp
3. WHEN a user closes the app or becomes inactive for 5 minutes THEN the system SHALL mark them as offline
4. WHEN viewing provider profiles THEN the system SHALL display online status with a green indicator
5. WHEN a user goes offline THEN the system SHALL show their last seen time (e.g., "Last seen 2 hours ago")

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a client, I want to filter providers by their online status and recent activity, so that I can prioritize contacting providers who are most likely to be available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN no filter is applied THEN the system SHALL show all providers with their respective online status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a provider, I want to control my online status visibility, so that I can manage when clients can see that I'm available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider accesses privacy settings THEN the system SHALL provide options to show/hide online status
2. WHEN online status is hidden THEN the system SHALL show "Last seen recently" instead of exact time
3. WHEN a provider sets "Do Not Disturb" mode THEN the system SHALL show them as offline regardless of activity

5. IF a provider chooses to appear offline THEN the system SHALL respect this setting while maintaining functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see real-time online status updates in chat conversations, so that I know if the other person is currently available to respond.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in a chat conversation THEN the system SHALL display the other user's current online status
2. WHEN the other user comes online during chat THEN the system SHALL update their status in real-time
3. WHEN the other user goes offline during chat THEN the system SHALL show their last seen time
4. WHEN typing in chat THEN the system SHALL show "typing..." indicator to the other user
5. WHEN user stops typing for 3 seconds THEN the system SHALL hide the typing indicator

5. IF system performance degrades THEN the system SHALL have configurable limits for concurrent connections

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a mobile app user, I want my online status to be accurately reflected even when switching between background and foreground, so that other users see my correct availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN app goes to background THEN the system SHALL maintain connection for 2 minutes before marking offline
2. WHEN app returns to foreground THEN the system SHALL immediately mark user as online
3. WHEN device loses internet connection THEN the system SHALL mark user as offline after connection timeout
