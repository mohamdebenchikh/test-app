# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds response metrics tracking to provider profiles, allowing clients to see how quickly and reliably providers respond to messages and service requests. The metrics include average response time and response rate, helping clients make informed decisions when choosing providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a client, I want to see a provider's average response time and response rate on their profile, so that I can choose providers who are likely to respond quickly to my inquiries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client views a provider's profile THEN the system SHALL display the provider's average response time in a human-readable format (e.g., "2 hours", "30 minutes")
2. WHEN a client views a provider's profile THEN the system SHALL display the provider's response rate as a percentage (e.g., "85% response rate")
3. WHEN a provider has no message history THEN the system SHALL display "No response data available" or similar message
4. WHEN displaying response metrics THEN the system SHALL only show metrics for providers (not regular clients)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a provider, I want my response metrics to be calculated accurately based on my actual message responses, so that my profile reflects my true responsiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider receives a message from a client THEN the system SHALL start tracking response time from that moment
2. WHEN a provider responds to a client's message THEN the system SHALL calculate and record the response time
3. WHEN calculating average response time THEN the system SHALL use only responses that occurred within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., 7 days)
4. WHEN calculating response rate THEN the system SHALL count messages that received a response within 24 hours as "responded"
5. WHEN a provider sends multiple responses to the same initial message THEN the system SHALL only count the first response for timing calculations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want response metrics to be updated automatically and efficiently, so that the data remains current without impacting system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider sends a response message THEN the system SHALL update their response metrics in real-time
2. WHEN calculating metrics THEN the system SHALL only consider the last 30 days of message activity
3. WHEN storing response data THEN the system SHALL optimize database queries to prevent performance degradation
4. WHEN a message thread becomes inactive for more than 7 days without response THEN the system SHALL count it as "no response" for rate calculations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a client, I want to understand what the response metrics mean, so that I can properly interpret the information when choosing providers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN response metrics are displayed THEN the system SHALL include tooltips or help text explaining what each metric means
2. WHEN showing average response time THEN the system SHALL indicate the time period used for calculation (e.g., "Based on last 30 days")
3. WHEN showing response rate THEN the system SHALL indicate what constitutes a "response" (e.g., "Responses within 24 hours")
4. WHEN metrics are based on limited data THEN the system SHALL indicate the sample size (e.g., "Based on 5 conversations")
