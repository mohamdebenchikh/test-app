# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables service providers to enhance their profiles with visual content through a portfolio system. Providers can upload images to showcase their work, explain their services, or present personal photos. The system includes a flexible file upload configuration that supports both local storage and cloud storage services (AWS S3, etc.), with configurable limits for media count and file sizes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to upload images to my profile portfolio, so that I can showcase my work and services to potential clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider accesses their profile edit page THEN the system SHALL display a portfolio/media upload section
2. WHEN a provider selects images to upload THEN the system SHALL validate file types (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
3. WHEN a provider uploads valid images THEN the system SHALL store them according to the configured storage method
4. WHEN a provider uploads images THEN the system SHALL enforce the configured maximum file count limit
5. WHEN a provider uploads images THEN the system SHALL enforce the configured maximum file size limit
6. WHEN a provider uploads images THEN the system SHALL provide real-time upload progress feedback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to organize my portfolio images with descriptions, so that clients can understand what each image represents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider uploads an image THEN the system SHALL allow them to add an optional description/caption
2. WHEN a provider views their portfolio THEN the system SHALL display images with their descriptions
3. WHEN a provider wants to reorder images THEN the system SHALL allow drag-and-drop reordering
4. WHEN a provider wants to delete an image THEN the system SHALL remove it from storage and update the portfolio

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a client browsing providers, I want to view provider portfolios, so that I can assess their work quality and service offerings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client views a provider's public profile THEN the system SHALL display the provider's portfolio images
2. WHEN a client clicks on a portfolio image THEN the system SHALL show a larger view with description
3. WHEN a provider has no portfolio images THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate placeholder message
4. WHEN viewing portfolio images THEN the system SHALL optimize image loading for performance

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure file upload settings, so that I can control storage costs and system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set maximum file size per image
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to set maximum number of images per provider
3. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to specify allowed file types
4. WHEN configuring the system THEN the administrator SHALL be able to choose between local and cloud storage
5. IF cloud storage is selected THEN the administrator SHALL be able to configure AWS S3 credentials and bucket settings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible storage configuration, so that I can switch between local storage and cloud services without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read storage configuration from environment variables or config files
2. WHEN using local storage THEN the system SHALL store files in a configurable local directory
3. WHEN using AWS S3 THEN the system SHALL upload files to the configured S3 bucket
4. WHEN switching storage methods THEN existing functionality SHALL continue to work without code modifications
5. WHEN storage fails THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages to users

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want image processing capabilities, so that uploaded images are optimized for web display.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL generate multiple sizes (thumbnail, medium, full)
2. WHEN generating image variants THEN the system SHALL maintain aspect ratios
3. WHEN serving images THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate image sizes based on context
4. WHEN processing images THEN the system SHALL compress them for optimal web performance
5. IF image processing fails THEN the system SHALL store the original and log the error

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified file upload service, so that other parts of the application can easily handle file uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing file uploads THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable upload service
2. WHEN using the upload service THEN it SHALL handle both local and cloud storage transparently
3. WHEN uploading files THEN the service SHALL return consistent metadata regardless of storage method
4. WHEN files are deleted THEN the service SHALL clean up from the appropriate storage location
5. WHEN storage configuration changes THEN existing upload functionality SHALL adapt automatically
