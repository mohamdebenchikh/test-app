# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature establishes a configurable social authentication system that can be easily enabled and disabled through configuration settings. The system will support multiple OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, etc.) with a unified interface that allows administrators to enable specific providers by simply adding API keys and secrets to the configuration without requiring code changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure social authentication providers through environment variables, so that I can enable or disable specific OAuth providers without modifying code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read OAuth provider configurations from environment variables
2. WHEN an OAuth provider has valid credentials configured THEN the system SHALL automatically enable that provider's authentication endpoints
3. WHEN an OAuth provider lacks required credentials THEN the system SHALL disable that provider without affecting other providers
4. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL support hot-reloading of OAuth provider settings

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate using my existing social media accounts, so that I can quickly access the application without creating new credentials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the login page THEN I SHALL see buttons for all enabled OAuth providers
2. WHEN I click on a social provider button THEN the system SHALL redirect me to the provider's OAuth authorization page
3. WHEN I successfully authenticate with the provider THEN the system SHALL create or link my account and log me in
4. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow me to try again

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a unified OAuth interface, so that adding new social providers requires minimal code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing a new OAuth provider THEN the system SHALL use a standardized provider interface
2. WHEN a new provider is added THEN it SHALL follow the same configuration pattern as existing providers
3. WHEN provider-specific logic is needed THEN it SHALL be contained within the provider's implementation without affecting the core authentication flow
4. WHEN testing OAuth providers THEN the system SHALL support mock providers for development and testing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my social authentication to be linked to my existing account, so that I can use multiple login methods for the same account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I authenticate with a social provider and already have an account with the same email THEN the system SHALL link the social account to my existing account
2. WHEN I have multiple social providers linked THEN I SHALL be able to login using any of them
3. WHEN I want to unlink a social provider THEN I SHALL be able to do so from my account settings
4. WHEN unlinking would leave me without any authentication method THEN the system SHALL prevent the unlinking and display a warning

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of OAuth authentication attempts, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts OAuth authentication THEN the system SHALL log the attempt with provider, timestamp, and outcome
2. WHEN OAuth authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
3. WHEN suspicious OAuth activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security warnings
4. WHEN reviewing authentication logs THEN sensitive information SHALL be excluded or masked

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want OAuth authentication to follow security best practices, so that user data and authentication flows remain secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling OAuth flows THEN the system SHALL use PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) where supported
2. WHEN storing OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive token data
3. WHEN OAuth sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically where possible
4. WHEN detecting OAuth security issues THEN the system SHALL invalidate affected sessions and require re-authentication
